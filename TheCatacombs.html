		<p><a href="https://github.com/xGoosefer/QuakeMaps">The catacombs</a> is my first ever multiplayer map, made in trenchbroom for quake.</p>

<p>The layout is designed to encourage a healthy game flow throughout the map, allowing players to continue moving and not feel as though they are cornered by the environment. </p>

		<p>This was my very first time making a map for quake, so i wanted to go with a similar theme to what existed already in order to focus more on level construction. I took a lot of inspiration from the French catacombs, and tried my best to replicate the look with textures of stone, rubble, and bones.</p>

		<p>The map was created in a little over a week, and went through plenty of playtesting to get the feeling of movement right.</p>
