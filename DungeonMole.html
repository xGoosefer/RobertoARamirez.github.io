		<p><a href="https://sonki-boy.itch.io/dungeon-mole">Dungeon Mole</a> is one of the biggest games I have worked on as of 2025. I came during the later half of production to help work on the final levels for the game. This would also be the first time where I worked with other people who had the same skill sets, so I was very open to receiving and implementing feedback from my team.</p>

<p>While on the team, my main work was coming up with design concepts for levels, creating layouts with others, greyboxing in Unity, and working with artists and programmers to get the final state of the level complete. </p>

		<p>Levels were fianlly done in under 13 weeks, not including a massive restart of levels due to a change in game loop. But even with this setback we were still able to utilize assets that were already made to create more engaing and fun levels for our players who helped us give plenty of feedback during prodcution.</p>
