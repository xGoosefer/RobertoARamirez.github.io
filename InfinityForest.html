		<p>This was a quick level I made for quake during December of 2023. It was my first time designing a single player map using the trenchbroom engine.</p>

</p>When deciding the theme for the map, i wanted to make something that was very different from what already existed. For that reason i went with an outdoor map and use a forest theme to help guide the process. Some areas look more manmade in order to add the human encampment aesthetic.</p>

		<p>This map was made in the span of a couple weeks. The layout provides enough space and obstacles to use to your advantage while traversing and dealing with the enemies. You only need to backtrack once throughout the whole map, making it player friendly as it gives off the illusion of being non-linear.</p>
